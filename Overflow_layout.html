    <h2>Visible Overflow :</h2>
    <div class="Visible">
        <p>Default behavior: The content is not clipped, and it will display outside the container.

            Use cases:
            
            When you want the overflowing content to be fully visible.
            
            For simple layouts where clipping isn’t an issue.
            
            Considerations:
            
            Can lead to design inconsistencies if elements break out of their designated areas.
            
            Might cause unwanted overlaps in more complex layouts.</p>
    </div><br><br><p></p><br><br>

    <h2>Hidden Overflow :</h2>
    <div class="Hidden">
        <p>When you want to restrict content visibility strictly within the boundaries.

            Useful in fixed-size components like cards or modals.
            
            Considerations:
            
            It may hide essential content if not managed carefully.
            
            No scrollbars are provided, so users can’t access the clipped content.</p>
    </div><br>
    <h2>Scroll Overflow:</h2>
    <div class="Scroll">
        <p>What it does: Scrollbars are always provided (both horizontal and vertical) regardless of whether the content overflows.

            Use cases:
            
            When you need to ensure that users are aware that more content exists.
            
            In scenarios where constant scrolling options are preferred, even if not needed immediately.
            
            Considerations:
            
            Can lead to an unnecessary visual clutter if the content does not always overflow.
            
            May not provide the best user experience if scrollbars appear when not needed.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2>Auto Overflow :</h2>
    <div class="Auto">
        <p>Ideal for dynamic content sizes where overflow is uncertain.

            Balances between hidden (which clips the content) and scroll (which always shows scrollbars).</p>
